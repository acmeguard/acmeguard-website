                <h2>The Details Behind Each Challenge</h2>
                <p>Want to dive deeper? Here's the full breakdown of each certificate management pain point:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-grid">
                <div class="why-card">
                    <div class="why-icon">

                    </div>
                    <h3>ACME Automation is Essential</h3>
                    <p>Certificate lifetimes are shrinking to 47 days by 2029. Manual renewal isn't sustainable, but you need ACME automation for both public and internal services without exposing private networks to the internet.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The CA/Browser Forum has mandated progressive reduction of certificate lifetimes. What used to be manageable with annual renewals becomes impossible with weekly renewals.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Complexity:</strong> Public services can use HTTP-01 challenges, but internal services like <code>api.company.com</code> and <code>admin.company.com</code> can't be exposed to the internet for ACME validation.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Central ACME gateway handles DNS-01 challenges for all services, internal and external, without internet exposure.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="why-card">
                    <div class="why-icon">
                        <i data-lucide="map"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Domain Exposure Blind Spots</h3>
                    <p>You need complete visibility of what domains your organization is exposing to the internet. Certificate Transparency logs reveal the full picture, but who's monitoring them systematically?</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> Every SSL certificate issued for your domains is logged in Certificate Transparency. This creates a public record of your entire internet-facing infrastructure.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Risk:</strong> Attackers use CT logs to discover your subdomains and services. If you're not monitoring them, you're missing both opportunities and threats.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Continuous CT log monitoring with intelligent alerting for new certificates across all CAs.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="why-card">
                    <div class="why-icon">
                        <i data-lucide="key"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Private CA Distribution Headaches</h3>
                    <p>Still distributing private root certificates across your infrastructure? Managing trust stores, handling revocation, and ensuring all clients accept your internal CA is complex and error-prone.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Maintenance Burden:</strong> Every device, container, and service needs your root CA. Updates require touching every system. Revocation is a nightmare.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Compatibility Issues:</strong> Mobile devices, third-party tools, and cloud services don't trust your private CA. You end up with mixed environments and security exceptions.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Use trusted public CAs for internal services through secure ACME proxying. No trust store management required.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="why-card">

                    </div>
                    <h3>Certificate Expiration Downtime</h3>
                    <p>That 3 AM wake-up call because someone forgot to renew a certificate and your API is down. Or worse - customers discovering your expired certificates before you do.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Human Factor:</strong> Manual certificate management doesn't scale. People forget, processes break, and critical services go down at the worst possible times.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Business Impact:</strong> Certificate outages affect customer trust, revenue, and team morale. They're often discovered by customers, not monitoring systems.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Automated renewal with intelligent alerting, approval workflows, and comprehensive expiration tracking across all certificates.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="why-card">

                        <i data-lucide="ghost"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Shadow IT Certificate Sprawl</h3>
                    <p>Teams spinning up services with their own certificates, using different CAs, different renewal processes. You discover them during security audits or when they break.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Discovery Problem:</strong> Development teams use whatever works fastest. Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL, cloud provider CAs - each with different lifecycles and management approaches.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Audit Nightmare:</strong> Security auditors want certificate inventories. You're building spreadsheets from multiple sources, hoping you haven't missed anything critical.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Centralized ACME gateway ensures all certificates flow through controlled workflows while maintaining team autonomy.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="why-card">

                    </div>
                    <h3>GenAI Amplifies Exposure Risk</h3>
                    <p>AI-powered development tools make it easier than ever for anyone in your organization to spin up services and expose them with proper SSL. The barrier to creating internet-facing services has never been lower.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Acceleration Effect:</strong> GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and other AI tools help developers create and deploy services faster than ever. Including SSL certificate setup.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Governance Gap:</strong> Traditional approval processes can't keep up with AI-accelerated development. Services appear online before security teams know they exist.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> ACME protocol governance ensures all certificates require approval workflows, regardless of how quickly services are created.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="why-card">
                    <div class="why-icon">
                        <i data-lucide="shield-alert"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Compliance and Audit Gaps</h3>
                    <p>Security auditors asking for certificate inventories, compliance frameworks requiring certificate lifecycle management, and you're manually tracking spreadsheets across multiple teams and CAs.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Regulatory Reality:</strong> SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS - all require certificate lifecycle management. Manual tracking doesn't meet audit standards.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Reporting Challenge:</strong> Auditors want comprehensive reports: what certificates exist, when they expire, who requested them, what approval process was followed.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Built-in compliance reporting with detailed audit trails for all certificate lifecycle events.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Per-Certificate Pricing Pain</h3>
                    <p>Enterprise CA solutions charging per certificate discourage security best practices. You want to use certificates everywhere they make sense, not ration them based on budget constraints.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Perverse Incentive:</strong> When certificates cost $50-200 each, teams avoid using them for internal services, development environments, and microservices.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Security Trade-off:</strong> Budget constraints force security compromises. Services run without SSL, use self-signed certificates, or share certificates inappropriately.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Flat-rate pricing encourages certificate best practices. Use certificates everywhere they improve security.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="why-card">

                    </div>
                    <h3>Team Coordination Chaos</h3>
                    <p>DevOps, Security, and Platform teams all managing certificates differently. No central authority, no consistent policies, no shared visibility into what's happening across your certificate landscape.</p>
                    <div class="why-details">
                        <p><strong>The Silos Problem:</strong> Each team has their own tools, processes, and certificate sources. What works for one team creates problems for others.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Communication Gap:</strong> Security teams don't know what DevOps is deploying. Platform teams can't enforce policies they can't see.</p>
                        <p><strong>AcmeGuard Solution:</strong> Unified platform with role-based access controls, team delegation, and centralized policy enforcement.</p>
